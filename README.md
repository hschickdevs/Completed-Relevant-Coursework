# Relevant-Coursework
This readme just includes a full list of all of my **relevant coursework** supplement my knowledge. I consider *relevant courses* to be courses that are in the scope of programming and finance, which is my peak interest. These courses are just a small portion of my learning, but I am using this repository to keep track of my various e-learning certificates.
