# Relevant-Coursework
All of my **relevant coursework** in progress & completed to supplement my knowledge of the intersection between computer science and finance. 
I consider *relevant courses* to be courses that are in the scope of computer science and finance (primarily investing & trading), which is my peak interest. 
These courses are a small portion of my learning, but I am using this repository to keep track of my various e-learning certificates.
